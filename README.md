# ZJU CG project 1: hierarchical Zbuffer
2024 fall semaster  
Implementation of a simple Zbuffer for mesh rendering, based on the course slides:  
- [x] scanline zbuffer algorithm
- [x] refined scanline zbuffer with hierachical Zbuffer
- [x] BVH + hierachical Zbuffer
- [ ] CUDA accelaration

Still a long way to go for this naive project. Any suggestions are appreciated!
